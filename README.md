As Latin Americans, we understand the magnitude of our roots, but these are cultures that are slowly being lost in history. What if we save them in a decentralized database? This project was generated as a team during Platzi's Ethereum Developer Program and seeks to be a turning point in preserving and supporting aboriginal cultures in Latin America; using Blockchain technology, we aim to globalize knowledge about these societies while generating a sense of ownership in our region.

## How do we help?
- We generate a blockchain network in which millenary data about these cultures is preserved.
- We generate NFTs that keep this information decentralized and incentivize allocating funds to the communities.
- We create a donation system based on Blockchain with which capital can be allocated to these communities.
- We promote the use and commercialization of handicrafts from these communities using non-fungible tokens.

## How is it built?
- Solidity
- React
- Next.js
- Styled Components
- Material UI
